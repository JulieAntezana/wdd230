                <p class="description">"The r.e.m. beauty homepage is a nice example of the Rule of Three. This design
                  theory says that if you draw two imaginary horizontal lines to divide the design
                  in to thirds and then further divide the design vertically by drawing two vertical
                  lines, you end up with a grid similar to tic tac toe. Research has shown that 
                  people tend to look at the four places where the lines intersect, following a 
                  typical pattern. First we tend to look at intersection of lines to the upper
                  left of center. Then we move downward to the lower left, across to the upper
                  right, and finally to the lower right. Here, Ariana Grande's eyes are the 
                  main focal point, located optimally near the upper left of center. The dramatic
                  makeup on her eyes form a "whoosh" shape that both points up toward the name
                  of the brand, but also downward toward the lower left to discover the message
                  that begins on her shoulder but then enters a clean white space. The eyes are
                  thus drawn downward to see the products that match what Ariana is wearing, and 
                  back up to the right. There we encounter the call to action, a large black button 
                  that says, "explore." The button is surrounded by contrasting empty white space. 
                  We won't fail to notice it."

                <p class="description">"Digital China shows how proximity can be used to organize text and images
                  that at are like a drawing by Escher with stair and walls and writing that
                  often changes direction and orientation. "Digital China" and "minor" refers
                  to a series of courses that applied science majors can take to minor in Chinese
                  digital technology. In close proximity large monitors and hovering drones as well 
                  as students scattered throughout. The center portion of the design presents the
                  courses in the program. It isn't shown in this image, but if you click any of the 
                  buttons, a description of the corresponding course will appear on the marquee. 
                  The lower section of the design is a grid of icons for well-known chinese apps. 
                  There is an image of pacman and some ghosts floating along a dotted path on the grid. 
                  The design is colorful and fun, and full of interesting things to look at. It tells 
                  a story as the eyes travel from the title down to contact information at the bottom."

                <p id="paragraph-third">"Third by Kinjiro is a fascinating example of contrast in design. 
                  It creates drama as the contrasting colors reveal a story meant to draw the 
                  viewer in. The text in the center asks, "What would you make?"
                  You discover that dragging the mouse creates a wide brush stroke of red paint 
                  across the page, reavealing a hidden message underneath. Suddenly, animation
                  fills the page with broad brush strokes of vibrant red. Now you are able to 
                  read the new message in brightly contrasting white font. 
                  "Make your mark. Build your future. Enter."
